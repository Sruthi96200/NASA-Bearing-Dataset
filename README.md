# NASA-Bearing-Dataset
IMS-Rexnord Bearing Dataset includes vibration data from test-to-failure experiments on four bearings at 2000 RPM under a 6000 lbs load. Three datasets capture failures in the inner/outer race and roller elements at a 20 kHz sampling rate. Provided by IMS, University of Cincinnati, it's useful for predictive maintenance and fault detection.
